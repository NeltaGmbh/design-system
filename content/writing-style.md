## Our voice and tone

### Be Bold

Have a stone weight feeling of a company. Be large, and on point. Be genuine and transparent to show users that we’re always acting in their best interest.

### Be Optimistic

Focusing on the details gives people confidence in our services. Letting people know that our work will help them complete the tasks of their jobs at a glance. Be on the journey with them and highlight key points that will help them the most. Be in the moment by focussing attention on the important bits first.

### Be Trustworthy

Giving people enough information to trust the work and let in Nelta’s hand. Show the possibilities of what can be accomplished by giving examples of how other people accomplish the same task, or by presenting the ideal state. Describe the end result, giving expert testimony, or offer opportunities for advanced knowledge. Offer best practices and recommendations for the next steps while suggesting ways to improve and make decisions.
