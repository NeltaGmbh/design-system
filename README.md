## For developers

### Installation

#### CSS

Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```text
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nelta-framework@1.0.0/dist/bundle.css">
```

#### JS

Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/), and our own JavaScript plugins. We use [jQueryâ€™s slim build](https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/), but the full version is also supported.

```text
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.2.3/dist/ionicons.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nelta-framework@1.0.0/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```
