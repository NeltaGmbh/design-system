# Values

## Seeking for the best

Even though we work with different problems we always try to do our best at work. And if that’s not enough, we go further on that.

## Don't \#@!% the customer

Customers are our lifeblood. Without happy customers, we’re doomed. So considering the customer perspective - collectively, not just a handful - comes first.

## Play, as a team

We spend a huge amount of our time at work. So the more that time doesn’t feel like “work,” the better. We can be serious, without taking ourselves too seriously. We strive to put what’s right for the team first – whether in a meeting room or on a football pitch.

## Be the change you seek

All people at Nelta should have the courage and resourcefulness to spark change – to make better work. Continuous improvement is a shared responsibility. Action is an independent one.
