# Page header

The page header is a pattern that helps define the uppermost part a webpage or product. The page header pattern is a template that helps combine other components \(breadcrumbs, headings, actions, and selects\) to create a consistent user experience.

The standard page header contains:

1. **Grid/page:** The page or content area where the page header sits. Each page requires grid spacing to be set to account for page size and fixed/fluid pages.
2. **Breadcrumb:** [Breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumbs) are an optional secondary navigation aid that shows users their current location in relation to the rest of the site.
3. **Title:** Page title summarizes the page content. The title wraps onto multi-lines when using fluid grid alignment and is truncated when using fixed grid alignment.
4. **Buttons:** Actions modify the page and its content. Use primary, secondary, subtle, compact, or other buttons defined in the [button guidelines](/components/button).
