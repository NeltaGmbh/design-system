# Forms

Forms are used to get information and guide people with minimal fuss. Designing forms well requires making decisions about structure, sequence, interface elements, field labels, help, and feedback.

## Style

### Accessibility

Autofocus the first field by default. This allows users to tab through elements in the form in a logical way.

### Layout

Common form components include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, selects, date pickers, toggles, and buttons.

## Button positioning

Buttons are sorted by importance from right to left, with the most important button \(primary\) on the right.
